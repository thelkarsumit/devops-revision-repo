## Core DevOps Concepts

1. ### What is DevOps?

   DevOps is a set of practices that combines software development (Dev) and IT operations (Ops). It aims to shorten the systems development life cycle and provide continuous delivery with high software quality. DevOps is complementary with Agile software development; several DevOps aspects came from Agile methodology.

   **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

2. ### What are the benefits of DevOps?

   The main benefits of DevOps include:

   1. Faster delivery of features
   2. More stable operating environments
   3. Improved communication and collaboration
   4. More time to innovate (rather than fix/maintain)
   5. Reduced deployment failures and rollbacks
   6. Shorter mean time to recovery

   **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

3. ### What is Continuous Integration?

   Continuous Integration (CI) is a development practice where developers integrate code into a shared repository frequently, preferably several times a day. Each integration can then be verified by an automated build and automated tests.

   Key aspects of CI include:
   - Maintaining a single source repository
   - Automating the build
   - Making the build self-testing
   - Everyone commits to the baseline every day
   - Every commit builds on an integration machine
   - Keep the build fast
   - Test in a clone of the production environment
   - Make it easy to get the latest deliverables
   - Everyone can see the results of the latest build
   - Automate deployment

## Docker

6. ### What is Docker?

   Docker is a platform for developing, shipping, and running applications in containers. Containers allow developers to package up an application with all the parts it needs, such as libraries and other dependencies, and ship it all out as one package.

   **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

7. ### What is the difference between Docker Image and Docker Container?

   - **Docker Image:** A Docker image is a read-only template containing a set of instructions for creating a Docker container. It includes the application code, runtime, libraries, dependencies, and system tools.
   
   - **Docker Container:** A container is a runnable instance of an image. You can create, start, stop, move, or delete a container using the Docker API or CLI. A container is isolated from other containers and the host machine.

   **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

8. ### What is Dockerfile?

   A Dockerfile is a text document that contains all the commands a user could call on the command line to assemble an image. Using `docker build`, users can create an automated build that executes several command-line instructions in succession.

   Example of a simple Dockerfile:
   ```dockerfile
   FROM node:14
   WORKDIR /app
   COPY package*.json ./
   RUN npm install
   COPY . .
   EXPOSE 3000
   CMD ["npm", "start"]
   ```

## Kubernetes

11. ### What is Kubernetes?

    Kubernetes (K8s) is an open-source container orchestration platform that automates the deployment, scaling, and management of containerized applications. It was originally developed by Google and is now maintained by the Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF).

    **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

12. ### What are the main components of Kubernetes architecture?

    Kubernetes architecture consists of the following main components:

    1. **Master Node Components:**
       - API Server
       - etcd
       - Controller Manager
       - Scheduler

    2. **Worker Node Components:**
       - Kubelet
       - Container Runtime
       - Kube Proxy

    **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

13. ### What is a Pod in Kubernetes?

    A Pod is the smallest deployable unit in Kubernetes. It represents a single instance of a running process in your cluster. Pods can contain one or more containers, storage resources, a unique network IP, and options that govern how the container(s) should run.

    Example of a simple Pod YAML:
    ```yaml
    apiVersion: v1
    kind: Pod
    metadata:
      name: nginx-pod
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: nginx
        image: nginx:1.14.2
        ports:
        - containerPort: 80
    ```

## CI/CD

16. ### What is CI/CD Pipeline?

    A CI/CD Pipeline is a series of steps that must be performed in order to deliver a new version of software. A pipeline typically includes stages for:
    
    1. Building the code
    2. Running automated tests
    3. Deploying to staging/production environments
    
    Example of a basic Jenkins Pipeline:
    ```groovy
    pipeline {
        agent any
        stages {
            stage('Build') {
                steps {
                    sh 'npm install'
                    sh 'npm run build'
                }
            }
            stage('Test') {
                steps {
                    sh 'npm run test'
                }
            }
            stage('Deploy') {
                steps {
                    sh './deploy.sh'
                }
            }
        }
    }
    ```

## Infrastructure as Code

26. ### What is Infrastructure as Code?

    Infrastructure as Code (IaC) is the practice of managing and provisioning infrastructure through machine-readable definition files rather than physical hardware configuration or interactive configuration tools.

    Benefits of IaC:
    - Version Control
    - Reproducibility
    - Automation
    - Documentation
    - Consistency
    - Scalability

    **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

27. ### What is Terraform?

    Terraform is an open-source IaC software tool that enables you to safely and predictably create, change, and improve infrastructure. It codifies cloud APIs into declarative configuration files.

    Example of a simple Terraform configuration:
    ```hcl
    provider "aws" {
      region = "us-west-2"
    }

    resource "aws_instance" "example" {
      ami           = "ami-0c55b159cbfafe1f0"
      instance_type = "t2.micro"

      tags = {
        Name = "example-instance"
      }
    }
    ```

28. ### What is Ansible?

    Ansible is an open-source automation tool that automates software provisioning, configuration management, and application deployment. It uses YAML syntax for expressing automation jobs.

    Example of an Ansible playbook:
    ```yaml
    ---
    - name: Install and configure web server
      hosts: webservers
      become: yes
      
      tasks:
        - name: Install nginx
          apt:
