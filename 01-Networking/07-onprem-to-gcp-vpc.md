### **Chapter 7: On-prem to GCP VPC**


#### **7.1 Hybrid Connectivity Overview**

**Hybrid Connectivity** refers to the integration of on-premises networks with cloud environments (like GCP) to extend the existing network and resources into the cloud. It enables seamless communication between on-prem systems and cloud-hosted services.

##### **Basic Concepts:**
- **What is Hybrid Connectivity?**
  Hybrid connectivity allows businesses to link their on-prem network infrastructure with Google Cloud's resources. This involves securely routing traffic between on-premises systems (like data centers) and GCP virtual machines, services, and applications.
  
- **Key Hybrid Connectivity Tools in GCP:**
  - **Cloud VPN**: Provides secure IPsec VPN tunnels between on-prem and GCP over the internet.
  - **Cloud Interconnect**: A more robust solution for hybrid connectivity, offering dedicated or partner interconnects for higher bandwidth and lower latency.
  - **Cloud Router**: A fully managed service that enables dynamic routing and BGP (Border Gateway Protocol) with your on-prem network.

#### **7.2 Cloud VPN Setup**

**Cloud VPN** allows you to connect your on-premises network to your Google Cloud VPC through an encrypted tunnel. This is suitable for connecting remote offices, branch networks, or data centers to the cloud.

##### **Basic Concepts:**
- **What is Cloud VPN?**
  Cloud VPN provides a secure, encrypted IPsec VPN tunnel between your on-prem network and GCP’s VPC. It allows the transfer of data securely over public networks.

- **Components of Cloud VPN:**
  - **Tunnel**: The encrypted connection between your on-prem network and the cloud.
  - **Gateway**: A Google Cloud VPN gateway is set up on the GCP side to accept incoming VPN tunnels.
  - **Routing**: Cloud VPN uses static or dynamic (via BGP) routing to determine how traffic flows between the networks.

##### **Steps to Set Up Cloud VPN**:
1. **Create a VPN Gateway in GCP**:
   - Choose a region where you want to set up the VPN gateway.
   - Define the IP address for the gateway.
   
2. **Create the VPN Tunnel**:
   - Set up the tunnel parameters (peer IP, shared secret, and tunnel options like IP ranges).
   - Configure the on-prem VPN gateway with the same settings.

3. **Configure Routing**:
   - Use static routes (if you are manually managing routing) or configure BGP routing to exchange route information dynamically.

##### **Hands-On Tasks**:
- Set up a Cloud VPN tunnel between an on-prem network and a GCP VPC.
- Test connectivity by pinging resources in the GCP VPC from the on-prem network.

#### **7.3 Cloud Interconnect Setup**

**Cloud Interconnect** is a solution for organizations that require higher bandwidth, lower latency, and more reliable network connections between on-prem systems and Google Cloud. It provides dedicated and partner interconnects.

##### **Basic Concepts:**
- **What is Cloud Interconnect?**
  Cloud Interconnect connects on-premises networks to Google Cloud’s network via a physical link, offering two types:
  - **Dedicated Interconnect**: Direct, physical connection between on-prem and GCP.
  - **Partner Interconnect**: Allows you to connect to GCP through an authorized service provider.

- **When to Use Cloud Interconnect**:
  - When you need a higher and more reliable bandwidth connection than Cloud VPN.
  - For organizations that require more secure and low-latency links between on-prem and cloud systems.

##### **Advanced Concepts:**
- **Dedicated Interconnect**:
  - This is a high-performance option providing speeds from 10 Gbps to 100 Gbps. It offers private, low-latency connectivity to Google Cloud resources.
  - The setup involves a connection between your data center and a Google Cloud edge location. The interconnect service includes the link, physical infrastructure, and maintenance.
  
- **Partner Interconnect**:
  - Used for organizations that do not have the physical infrastructure for dedicated interconnects.
  - Provides flexibility with lower bandwidth options ranging from 50 Mbps to 10 Gbps, and the interconnect is managed by the partner.

##### **Steps to Set Up Cloud Interconnect**:
1. **Choose a Provider**: If using Partner Interconnect, choose a supported provider. If using Dedicated Interconnect, set up the physical connection to Google Cloud.
2. **Create Interconnect Connections**: Set up the interconnect connections in GCP, configuring IP ranges and VLANs.
3. **Configure BGP with Cloud Router**: Use Cloud Router to set up dynamic routing over the interconnect.

##### **Hands-On Tasks**:
- Set up Partner or Dedicated Interconnect based on your need.
- Configure a Cloud Router and test the interconnect connection.

#### **7.4 Cloud Router for BGP (Dynamic Routing)**

**Cloud Router** is a fully managed service in GCP that automatically handles the Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) between your on-prem network and GCP's VPC. It is commonly used for Cloud VPN or Cloud Interconnect setups to dynamically exchange routing information.

##### **Basic Concepts:**
- **What is BGP?**
  BGP is the protocol used to exchange routing information between networks. When you use Cloud VPN or Cloud Interconnect, BGP helps dynamically exchange route information without the need to configure static routes.

- **How Cloud Router Works**:
  Cloud Router uses BGP to communicate between GCP and your on-prem network. It automatically adjusts routes as network conditions change, ensuring the most efficient routing of traffic.

##### **Advanced Concepts:**
- **BGP Peering**:
  Cloud Router supports multiple BGP peers, allowing you to configure dynamic routing between on-prem and cloud environments with multiple routes and failover.

- **Route Advertisements**:
  Cloud Router can be configured to advertise specific routes to your on-prem network based on the IP ranges you define.

##### **Steps to Set Up Cloud Router**:
1. **Create a Cloud Router** in GCP, define the network region, and set up BGP.
2. **Configure BGP Peering** between Cloud Router and your on-prem router.
3. **Advertise Routes** from your on-prem network to the cloud using Cloud Router's route advertisement feature.

##### **Hands-On Tasks**:
- Configure Cloud Router for BGP dynamic routing.
- Set up BGP peering and verify route advertisement between on-prem and GCP.

#### **7.5 On-Prem to GCP Network Security**

When connecting on-premises to Google Cloud, network security becomes a crucial aspect to ensure that only authorized traffic flows between the systems. It’s essential to configure firewalls and secure routes.

##### **Basic Concepts:**
- **Firewall Configuration**: Use GCP firewall rules to allow or deny traffic between on-prem and GCP.
- **IPsec VPN Security**: Ensure that the VPN tunnel is secured using IPsec, preventing unauthorized access.

##### **Advanced Concepts:**
- **Custom Firewall Rules**: Set up firewall rules to allow specific traffic based on IP, port, and protocol for on-prem systems connecting to GCP.
- **Traffic Inspection & Monitoring**: Integrate GCP’s security tools like **Cloud Security Command Center** or **VPC Flow Logs** for monitoring traffic between your on-prem and GCP networks.

##### **Steps to Secure the Connection**:
1. **Set Up Firewall Rules**: Create rules that only allow specific ports or protocols (such as SSH or HTTP) for the on-prem network.
2. **Configure Traffic Monitoring**: Use tools like **VPC Flow Logs** to monitor traffic between your on-prem network and GCP.

##### **Hands-On Tasks**:
- Implement secure firewall rules in GCP to control the flow of traffic.
- Set up and monitor VPC Flow Logs for traffic analysis.
