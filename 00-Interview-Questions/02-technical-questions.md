Here is a list of 60 technical questions and answers based on the DevOps, cloud computing, Kubernetes, Terraform, CI/CD.

### **Terraform and Infrastructure as Code (IaC)**

1. **What is Terraform, and why is it used?**
   - **Answer**: Terraform is an open-source Infrastructure as Code (IaC) tool that allows you to define and provision infrastructure using configuration files. It helps automate the process of setting up, modifying, and managing cloud resources.

2. **What are the different Terraform providers, and how do they work?**
   - **Answer**: Providers are plugins that Terraform uses to interact with cloud platforms or services. For example, AWS, Azure, Google Cloud, etc. Each provider is responsible for managing the lifecycle of resources on its respective platform.

3. **What are Terraform modules?**
   - **Answer**: Modules in Terraform are reusable configurations that allow for the organization of infrastructure code. They help create consistent and reusable configurations for common resources, which can be shared across different parts of your infrastructure.

4. **Explain Terraform state.**
   - **Answer**: Terraform state is a representation of the infrastructure Terraform manages. It tracks the resources and their current state, allowing Terraform to detect changes and perform updates on infrastructure.

5. **How does Terraform handle dependencies between resources?**
   - **Answer**: Terraform automatically handles dependencies between resources using resource graphing. It determines the order in which resources need to be created or modified based on their interdependencies.

6. **What is the difference between `terraform plan` and `terraform apply`?**
   - **Answer**: `terraform plan` generates an execution plan to show what changes Terraform will make to the infrastructure. `terraform apply` applies the changes to the actual infrastructure based on the plan.

7. **What is the use of `terraform import`?**
   - **Answer**: `terraform import` is used to import existing resources into Terraform management. This allows you to bring external resources under Terraform's control without recreating them.

8. **How does Terraform handle versioning?**
   - **Answer**: Terraform uses version control for both its configuration files and provider plugins. You can specify the version of a provider or module you wish to use, and Terraform ensures that the correct version is used for your infrastructure.

9. **What is a `data source` in Terraform?**
   - **Answer**: A data source in Terraform allows you to query existing resources or information from your cloud provider and use that data in your Terraform configuration.

10. **What is the `terraform destroy` command?**
    - **Answer**: `terraform destroy` is used to delete all the resources defined in a Terraform configuration. It removes all the infrastructure managed by Terraform.

    - **Answer**: Declarative pipelines are a simpler, more structured approach to defining Jenkins Pipelines, while scripted pipelines provide more flexibility by using Groovy code for pipeline definition.

16. **How do you set up a webhook in Jenkins?**
    - **Answer**: Webhooks in Jenkins can be configured to trigger builds automatically when changes are pushed to a Git repository. This is typically done by adding the webhook URL to the repository settings.

17. **What is a Jenkins node?**
    - **Answer**: A Jenkins node is a machine that is part of the Jenkins environment. The master node controls the build execution, while worker nodes execute the builds and tests.

18. **What is the purpose of Jenkins plugins?**
    - **Answer**: Jenkins plugins extend the functionality of Jenkins by adding new features such as integration with version control systems, deployment tools, or communication platforms.

19. **What is a build trigger in Jenkins?**
    - **Answer**: A build trigger in Jenkins is an event or condition that automatically starts a build. Triggers can include code changes, scheduled times, or manual initiation.

20. **How does Jenkins handle parallel builds?**
